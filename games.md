## **EC2 Mac for Games**
---
#### Accelerate iOS game development with On-Demand Access to macOS with Amazon EC2 Mac

With the ability to provision and access macOS environments within minutes and dynamically scale capacity as needed, EC2 Mac enables faster game delivery to market. To learn more about why build games with Amazon EC2 Mac, listen to [this on-demand webinar.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBR-RErR8hM)


Another benefit is the ability to consolidate build pipelines for Android, Windows, and Apple in a single environment, eliminating fragmented development workflows. Whether you build with Unity, Unreal, or other Games engines, take a look at this CI/CD [reference architecture](https://d1.awsstatic.com/architecture-diagrams/ArchitectureDiagrams/game-production-in-the-cloud-cicd-ra.pdf) in AWS cloud and reach out to your AWS Game Tech account team to learn more.
