## **Welcome to Amazon EC2 Mac Instances!**

[Amazon EC2 Mac Instances](https://aws.amazon.com/mac) enable you to run on-demand macOS workloads in the cloud for the first time, extending the flexibility, scalability, and cost benefits of AWS to all Apple developers. With EC2 Mac instances, developers creating apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and Safari can provision and access macOS environments within minutes, dynamically scale capacity as needed, and benefit from AWSâ€™s pay-as-you-go pricing.

x86-based EC2 Mac instances are built on Apple Mac mini computers, featuring Intel Core i7 processors, and are powered by the [AWS Nitro System](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/). They offer a choice of macOS Catalina (10.15), macOS Big Sur (11), and macOS Monterey (12) as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs). M1-based EC2 Mac instances are built on Apple M1 Mac mini computers and are powered by the [AWS Nitro System](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/). EC2 M1 Mac instances enable Arm64 macOS environments for the first time on AWS and support macOS Big Sur (11) and macOS Monterey (12) as Amazon Machine Images (AMIs).

### **Getting Started with Amazon EC2 Mac Instances.**
---

Much of the work behind EC2 Mac instances is so that they look, feel, and act like any other EC2 instances, within the [macOS Software License Agreement](https://www.apple.com/legal/sla/docs/macOSBigSur.pdf). Do note that this SLA applies to *any company* using macOS - it's not unique to AWS or Amazon!
